## 📋 Password Examples and Results

| Password         | Strength   | Notes                                    |
|------------------|------------|------------------------------------------|
| `1234567890`     | Very Weak  | Too common, easily guessable             |
| `abcd1234`       | Very Weak  | Dictionary word                          |
| `qwerty123`      | Weak       | Predictable keyboard pattern             |
| `vishal@0906`    | Medium     | Some complexity, but still guessable     |
| `Iqwwd@10155`    | Strong     | Special chars, mixed case, good length   |

## 🔒 Key Learnings

- Weak passwords are easy targets for hackers using brute-force or dictionary attacks.
- Strong passwords include a mix of upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Longer passwords (12+ characters) are significantly harder to crack.

## 🧠 Best Practices for Strong Passwords

✅ Use at least 12–16 characters  
✅ Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols  
✅ Avoid names, dictionary words, or predictable patterns  
✅ Use a passphrase for easy recall (e.g., `Sunset$Rainbow!2025`)  
✅ Don’t reuse the same password across websites  
✅ Use a password manager for secure storage
